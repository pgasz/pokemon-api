# Small Pokemon React app
This is my small Pokemon React app. In this app I used pokemon API. Check API documentation [here](https://pokeapi.co/ "Pokemon API").

## UI Preview:
- List with initial 20 Pokémons, containing basic information like: ‘name’, `type` and ‘sprite’.
- Button to load more pokémons onto a screen.
- After clicking the pokémon from the list, you should see on screen extra details about its: ‘weight’ and ‘height’.
- UI doesn’t have to be perfect, just nice and minimalistic.
## Core technology stack:
- React
## Supplementary features
- UX enriching elements: loaders, transitions etc.
- simple implementation of dark and light theme.

## Installation
You should have installed node.js ( [check documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/ "check documentation") ) and npm ( [check documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm "check documentation") ) on your computer. These two are required to run this project locally.
1. Download file (clone repository or download and extend zip)
2. Open your terminal in the project directory and type 2 commands: \
   `npm install` 
   \
    `npm start` \
Now you are ready to use the project locally. Have fun! :-D
